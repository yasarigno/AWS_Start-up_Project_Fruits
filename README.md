### A Big Data project on AWS to assist a very young AgriTech start-up, called "Fruits!". 

[Click here](https://yasarigno.github.io/folder/P8_support.pdf) for the presentation file of the project.

Our start-up Fruits takes place in the [_AgriTech de France_](https://www.gouvernement.fr/actualite/la-french-agritech-au-service-de-l-innovation-agricole) and seeks to offer innovative solutions for fruit harvesting. The goal is to provide to the general public a mobile application that would allow users to take a picture of a fruit and obtain information about this fruit. Our mission is to implement a first version of the fruit image classification engine and to build in a Big Data environment a first data processing chain which will include preprocessing and a dimensionality reduction step. For this, we used [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) cloud tools to build a first data processing chain.

The important thing in this project is to set up the first processing bricks that will be used when it is necessary to scale up in terms of data volume! We need to take into account the fact that the volume of data will increase very quickly after the delivery of this project. We will therefore develop scripts in [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/) and use, for example, the AWS cloud to take advantage of a Big Data architecture (EC2, S3, IAM), based on an EC2 Linux server.

We will use [DataBricks](https://databricks.com) which is a very useful and easy-to-use platform. It is compatible with AWS (as well as with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/)).

### What is Big Data?:

Let us recall some facts concerning **Big Data**. What is Big Data? When we speak about it?

The definition of **Big Data** is as follows: more varied data, arriving in larger and larger volumes and with higher speed. This definition is also known as the three “V”s.

In other words, Big Data is made up of complex datasets, mostly from new sources. These datasets are so large that traditional data processing software cannot handle them. However these huge volumes of data can be used to solve problems that we could never have solved before.

But what are these three V's?

1. First **V** is the [volume](volume) of data. The amount of astronomical data generated by companies and people is constantly increasing. The volume of data generated therefore requires rethinking the way in which it is stored. For example, at the scale of Facebook, 100 GB is a small amount of data. We do big data when the quantity of data exceeds the ability of a machine to store and analyze it in an acceptable time.

2. It is not only volume that characterizes big data. There is also [variety](variety). The types of data and their sources are increasingly diverse. These new types of data include a large number of highly diversified content: text, images, videos, emails, books, tweets, audio recordings, etc.

3. The third characteristic is [velocity](velocity). With new technologies, data is generated ever faster and in much shorter times. Companies are obliged to collect and share them in real time, but the cycle of generating new data is renewed very quickly, quickly making information obsolete.

Let us recap :

[Definition](Definition): **Big data** refers to information resources whose characteristics in terms of volume, velocity and variety require the use of specific technologies and analytical methods to generate value and which generally exceed the capabilities of a single machine and require parallelized processing.

### How to deal with Big Data?: 

We need to take into account

- A strategy to be adopted to distribute the calculations between the machines,
- Distribution of the data between machines,
- Aggregation of results from different machines,
- What to do in case of failure of one of the machines during the execution of the calculation,
- How to ensure that the architecture deployed does not cost too much.

### Data source:

https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits

| DATA train  |   |
|---|---|
|  number of images |   67 692 |

| DATA test  |   |
|---|---|
|  number of images |   22 688 |

There are 131 classes. Each class is either a fruit or a vegetable.

The notebook contains first steps of preprocessing. The feaures of images are extracted using ResNet50 model. We are not required to perform a modelisation for now.
