### PROJET-8
### A Big Data project on AWS to help a very young AgriTech start-up, named "Fruits!". 
---

Our start-up Fruits is part of AgriTech de France and seeks to offer innovative solutions for fruit harvesting. The goal is to provide to the general public a mobile application that would allow users to take a picture of a fruit and obtain information about this fruit. Our mission is to implement a first version of the fruit image classification engine and to build in a Big Data environment a first data processing chain which will include preprocessing and a dimensionality reduction step. For this, we used [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) cloud tools to build a first data processing chain.
